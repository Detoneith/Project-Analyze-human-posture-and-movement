# Project Body Analyzer with stereo camera calibration and Fourier

## Description
This project was realized during Greta Meteor's internship with the collaboration of GeorgesSchmidt. This is an application that provides various body analysis functionalities using Fourier transformations. It allows users to perform video capture, depth estimation, image viewing, epi-cycles animation, and silhouette animation from Fourier coefficients.

## Features
- Video Capture: Capture video from two cameras and detect landmarks of human bodies.
- Depth Estimation: Estimate depth from two cameras (you will need a red object).
- Image View: Preview and analyze images.
- Epicycles and Signal Animation: Generate animations using Fourier Transform epi-cycles and signal data.
- Silhouette Animation: Create animated silhouettes with calculated Fourier Transform coefficients.
